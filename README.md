# Codsoft
Welcome to my Codsoft internship repository for the August batch - Level 3!

During my internship, I successfully completed three challenging tasks in C++ development. Here's a brief overview of each project:

#Task 1: To-Do List
I developed a feature-rich to-do list application using C++. This program allows users to create, manage, and organize their tasks efficiently. It includes functionalities such as adding tasks, marking them as complete, and removing tasks from the list.

#Task 2: Calculator
In this project, I created a user-friendly calculator application using C++. The calculator provides a simple and clean user interface, enabling users to perform basic arithmetic operations with ease. It's designed to handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.

#Task 3: Tic-Tac-Toe Game
For my final task, I implemented the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in C++. Players can engage in this two-player game, taking turns to make their moves. The program checks for winning conditions and declares a winner once a player achieves three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

I invite you to explore the code for each project in their respective folders. I hope you find my journey of growth and learning as a C++ developer inspiring. Thank you for visiting my GitHub repository!
